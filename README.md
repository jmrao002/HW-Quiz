# Description

This browser application allows users take a quiz about the television show "Spongebob Squarepants". On the homepage, the user can click a button to view their own saved toped scores, or they can begin the quiz by clicking "Start Quiz".

When taking the quiz, users are able to select from multiple response choices and are notified as to whether their response was correct or incorrect. A timer sits at the top of the page, and for each wrong answer, 15 seconds will be taken off the clock. If the user fails to complete the quiz before the clock hits zero, they are shown a button to start over. If the user succeeds in completing the quiz, they will be able to enter and submit their initials, which, along with their score (time remaining), is shown on the screen. Top scores are ordered from highest to lowest. From the top scores page, the user can choose to restart the game or to clear the top scores.

Questions for the quiz can easily be changed in the folder ./assets/js/questions.js. Adding or removing questions will not break the logic built into the application.
